Prior to running any of the Jupyter Notbooks or data download the neccesary files and create the environments to run with them.

# General Setup Guide:

Download [Andaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) to be able to install the environment and use your preference of commandline options or Editor to view the data.
To access the data go to the [Kaggle](kagglewebsite) and download the csv for your own experimentation. Then place the download in the data folder to allow for a smooth utilization of the prewritten code.

### Use the YAML files below to create the environments to run the data.

[`.yml`]

To utilize Geopandas:

[`.yml`]

All files are located in the main directory and src folder.
Run these two lines of code after the download to apply the kernals to your IDE.

`python -m ipykernel install --user --name tens --display-name "Python 3 (Capstone)"`

`python -m ipykernel install --user --name Capstone --display-name "Python 3 (visuals)"`
